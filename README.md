# CsPlusPlus-CS350

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

The final project was designed to implement a thermostat using the TI CC3220x LaunchXL to send data to SysTecâ€™s server software over Wi-Fi that uses the temperature sensors and the LEDs on the board. 

What did you do particularly well?

I created code in the c programming language that implements the thermostat.

Where could you improve?

I can improve on my coding practices for the C programming that is used on the embedded systems. 

What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?

I am adding the tools for the CC3220x LaunchXL coding program that can be used to implement programs on the embedded system. 

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?

The concepts and programming code can be transferrable to other projects.

How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

I used functions to adapt the code and maintain the project that implements the thermostat.
